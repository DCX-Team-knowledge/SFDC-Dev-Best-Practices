## Introduction
As a Salesforce Developer Consultant, it's crucial to follow established best practices to ensure that the solutions you build are scalable, secure, and easy to maintain. This repository consolidates these best practices and provides practical examples to help you in your day-to-day work.

## Best Practices
### Coding Standards
Writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code is key. Adhere to our coding standards to ensure consistency across projects.

- [General Coding Standards](Best_Practices/General_Standards/README.md): General coding best practices applicable across all Salesforce development.
- [Apex Coding Standards](Best_Practices/Apex_Standards/README.md): Guidelines specific to writing clean and efficient Apex code.
- [LWC Coding Standards](Best_Practices/LWC_Standards/README.md): Best practices for developing Lightning Web Components (LWC).

Make sure to follow these standards in every project to maintain high-quality, consistent code.

### Security
Security should be a top priority. Follow our [Security Guidelines](Best_Practices/Security.md) to ensure that your code respects Salesforce security best practices.

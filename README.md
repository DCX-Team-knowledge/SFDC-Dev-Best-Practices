## Introduction
As a Salesforce Developer Consultant, it's crucial to follow established best practices to ensure that the solutions you build are scalable, secure, and easy to maintain. This repository consolidates these best practices and provides practical examples to help you in your day-to-day work.

## Best Practices
### Coding Standards
Writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code is key. Adhere to our coding standards to ensure consistency across projects.

- [General Coding Standards](../Best_Practices/General_Standards/README.md): General coding best practices applicable across all Salesforce development.
- [Apex Coding Standards](Best_Practices/Apex_Standards/README.md): Guidelines specific to writing clean and efficient Apex code.
- [LWC Coding Standards](Best_Practices/LWC_Standards/README.md): Best practices for developing Lightning Web Components (LWC).

Make sure to follow these standards in every project to maintain high-quality, consistent code.

## Contributing
Thank you for considering contributing to our repository! We value the community's insights and ideas and encourage you to submit any new features, coding standards, or improvements. This page will guide you through the process.

## Best Practices

- Follow our [Documentation Best Practices](#documentation)
- Document your code thoroughly to make it easier for others to understand.
- Include examples, don't be shy

## Using ChatGPT for Assistance

If you're unsure about the structure of your documentation or need help generating markdown files, you can use ChatGPT as follows:

1. **Generate Markdown Files**: Ask ChatGPT to create a basic structure for your markdown file.
   - Example prompt: "Create a markdown template for a new coding standard in JavaScript."

2. **Edit Markdown Content**: Provide ChatGPT with raw content, and it can help structure, format, or proofread your markdown file.
   - Example prompt: "Help me improve the wording in this section of a markdown file."

## Getting Started

## How to Contribute

1. **Add New Content**:
   - All new additions must be well-documented and provide relevant examples when possible.
   - Ensure your content is clear and concise.

2. **Write in Markdown**:
   - Use appropriate headers (`#`, `##`, `###`) for clarity.
   - Keep bullet points or lists short and to the point.
   - Include code blocks where relevant:
     ```markdown
     ```bash
     # Sample code block
     echo "Hello, world!"
     ```
   - Ensure consistency across the document (spacing, indentation).

3. **Submit a Pull Request**:
   - Once you've made your changes, commit with a meaningful message:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Add new LWC coding standard"
     ```
   - Push to your fork:
     ```bash
     git push origin feature/your-feature-name
     ```
   - Open a pull request (PR) and provide a detailed description of the changes.
   - Link any relevant issues or discussions in the PR description.

## Review Process

Once you submit a pull request, a reviewer from our team will check for:
- Adherence to our coding standards
- Proper documentation and clarity
- Functional accuracy and completeness

We aim to review pull requests within 3-5 business days. You may be asked to make changes based on feedback. Once approved, your contribution will be merged into the main branch.

### Documentation
# Best Practices for Documentation

Below are the best practices for documenting coding standards. Click on each section to expand the details.

<details>
   <summary> 1. Structure and Organization </summary>
  
  - **Use Clear Categories**: Break down the coding standards into logical categories like "General Coding Standards," "Apex Coding Standards," and "LWC Coding Standards" to improve navigation.
  - **Subsections for Specific Topics**: Within each category, create subsections for topics like Naming Conventions, Commenting, Error Handling, etc.
  - **Table of Contents**: Include a table of contents at the top with links to sections for easier navigation.
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary>2. Consistent Formatting</summary>
  
  - **Markdown Usage**: Use consistent headers (`#`, `##`, `###`), lists, and code blocks to make the document visually appealing.
  - **Code Examples**: Provide code examples in fenced code blocks (```language) to ensure syntax highlighting and readability.
  - **Links to Documentation**: For advanced or company-specific rules, link to relevant documentation (e.g., Salesforce documentation for Apex standards).

</details>

<details>
  <summary>3. Clarity and Simplicity</summary>
  
  - **Keep it Simple**: Write standards in simple, concise language that is easy to understand.
  - **Justification and Explanation**: Provide reasoning for each rule, explaining why it’s necessary.
  - **Avoid Overwhelming Detail**: Focus on essential, impactful guidelines, avoiding overcomplication.
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary>4. Real-World Examples</summary>
  
  - **Good and Bad Examples**: Show both good and bad examples of code with explanations for each.
  - **Use Case Scenarios**: Provide practical examples of when to apply certain coding standards.
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary>5. Versioning and Updates</summary>
  
  - **Changelog**: Include a changelog that tracks updates to the coding standards.
  - **Use Git Version Control**: Use Git to track changes to standards, maintaining a version history.
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary>6. Enforcement Tools</summary>
  
  - **Static Code Analyzers**: Recommend or integrate tools like **ESLint** (for JavaScript) or **PMD** (for Apex) to enforce the standards.
  - **Pre-commit Hooks**: Suggest using Git pre-commit hooks to ensure standards are met before committing code.
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary>7. Collaboration and Contribution</summary>
  
  - **Collaborative Input**: Invite feedback from team members and include a process for contributing new standards.
  - **Peer Reviews**: Encourage peer code reviews to check for adherence to coding standards.
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary>8. Keep It Up to Date</summary>
  
  - **Ongoing Maintenance**: Review and update the document regularly to ensure it remains relevant.
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary>9. Customizable Template for Standards</summary>
  
  Create a template for adding new coding standards with the following sections:
  - Rule Name
  - Rule Description
  - Example Code (Good/Bad)
  - Why It Matters
  - Enforcement Mechanism (if any)
  - Related Links/Resources
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary>10. Examples of Popular Coding Standards</summary>
  
  - Include references to well-known coding standards, such as:

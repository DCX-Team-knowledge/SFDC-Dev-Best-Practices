# Salesforce Coding Standards

## 1. Apex Code Standards

- **Follow Naming Conventions**: Use meaningful names for classes, methods, and variables. Use CamelCase for class names (e.g., `AccountService`) and camelCase for methods and variables (e.g., `getAccountDetails`).
- **Governor Limits Awareness**: Be mindful of Salesforce governor limits (e.g., SOQL query limits, heap size limits, DML limits) and write optimized code.
- **Bulkification**: Write code that handles multiple records to avoid hitting governor limits. Use bulk DML operations instead of processing records one at a time.
- **Avoid Hardcoding**: Avoid hardcoding values like record IDs, field names, or picklist values. Use custom settings, labels, or metadata types.
- **Use Collections Wisely**: Use sets, maps, and lists appropriately to manage data efficiently and avoid repeated queries.
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling with try-catch blocks, custom exceptions, and user-friendly error messages.
- **Test Coverage**: Ensure that Apex classes and triggers have at least 75% test coverage. Write tests that cover positive, negative, and edge cases.
- **Avoid Recursive Triggers**: Prevent recursive triggers by using static variables to track state.

## 2. Trigger Best Practices

- **One Trigger per Object**: Implement a single trigger per object and delegate the logic to handler classes.
- **Trigger Framework**: Use a trigger framework (e.g., Trigger Handler pattern) to control execution flow and maintain structure.
- **Trigger Context Variables**: Use trigger context variables (`Trigger.new`, `Trigger.old`, etc.) appropriately to handle different operations.

## 3. SOQL and SOSL Best Practices

- **Avoid SOQL in Loops**: Never place SOQL queries inside `for` loops. Query data outside loops to minimize the number of queries.
- **Use Filters and Limits**: Use filters (WHERE clause) and limit the records returned by SOQL to avoid governor limits.
- **Use SELECT Fields Wisely**: Only query necessary fields. Avoid `SELECT *` to reduce data consumption and improve performance.

## 4. Visualforce, Lightning Components, and LWC Standards

- **Use Lightning Design System (SLDS)**: Follow SLDS guidelines for consistency with Salesforceâ€™s look and feel.
- **Component Modularity**: Design Lightning Web Components (LWC) or Aura Components as modular, reusable, and maintainable.
- **Avoid Heavy Client-side Logic**: Keep client-side logic lightweight to improve performance, especially on mobile.
- **Security Best Practices**: Avoid direct DOM manipulation and validate user inputs.

## 5. Security and Data Access

- **Field-Level Security**: Ensure code respects field-level security and sharing rules by using `WITH SECURITY_ENFORCED` in SOQL queries or `stripInaccessible`.
- **Avoid SOQL Injection**: Use bind variables in SOQL queries to prevent injection vulnerabilities.

## 6. Code Documentation and Comments

- **Comment Your Code**: Use comments to explain complex logic. Provide Javadoc-style comments for classes and methods.
- **Version Control**: Use version control systems like Git to manage code changes, track versions, and collaborate.

## 7. Performance Optimization

- **Efficient DML Operations**: Group DML operations (e.g., `insert`, `update`, `delete`) to minimize the number of statements and avoid governor limits.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Use asynchronous methods (`@future`, `Queueable`, `Batch Apex`) for long-running or resource-intensive operations.
- **Optimize Resource Usage**: Use platform cache, reduce API calls, and minimize data transfers to optimize performance.

## 8. Deployment and CI/CD

- **Automated Testing**: Integrate automated testing into your CI/CD pipeline to ensure code quality before deployment.
- **Package Your Code**: Use Salesforce DX to package and deploy code in a standardized manner.

Following these best practices ensures your Salesforce development is robust, scalable, and maintainable, providing a solid foundation for enterprise-level applications.

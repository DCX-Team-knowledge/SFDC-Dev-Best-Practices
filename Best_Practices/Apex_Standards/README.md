Apex is Salesforce's proprietary programming language used to implement complex business logic, triggers, and custom controllers on the Salesforce platform. To ensure code is efficient, maintainable, and scalable, it’s critical to adhere to well-defined coding standards. These guidelines help developers write clean, secure, and robust code while also optimizing for Salesforce’s unique platform constraints, such as governor limits. Following these standards not only improves the performance of your applications but also makes code easier to understand, debug, and extend. This section outlines best practices, naming conventions, and specific guidelines for writing high-quality Apex code.

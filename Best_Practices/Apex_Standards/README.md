Apex is Salesforceâ€™s language for implementing business logic, triggers, and custom controllers. Use this page to review key coding standards to ensure your code is efficient, maintainable, and scalable. Following these guidelines helps optimize performance, stay within governor limits, and make your code easier to understand and extend.

# Bulkifying Apex Code

Bulkifying Apex code ensures that it can handle large volumes of data efficiently, without hitting Salesforce governor limits. Salesforce imposes strict limits on the number of queries and database operations per transaction, and bulkifying allows your code to process multiple records in a single transaction. This practice not only optimizes performance but also prevents runtime exceptions that could cause your code to fail.

For an example of bulkifying Apex code, check out the [Examples.js](./Examples.js#L1) file.

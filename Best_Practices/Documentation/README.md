# Best Practices for Documentation

Below are the best practices for documenting coding standards. Click on each section to expand the details.

<details>
  1. Structure and Organization
  
  - **Use Clear Categories**: Break down the coding standards into logical categories like "General Coding Standards," "Apex Coding Standards," and "LWC Coding Standards" to improve navigation.
  - **Subsections for Specific Topics**: Within each category, create subsections for topics like Naming Conventions, Commenting, Error Handling, etc.
  - **Table of Contents**: Include a table of contents at the top with links to sections for easier navigation.

<details>
  <summary>2. Consistent Formatting</summary>
  
  - **Markdown Usage**: Use consistent headers (`#`, `##`, `###`), lists, and code blocks to make the document visually appealing.
  - **Code Examples**: Provide code examples in fenced code blocks (```language) to ensure syntax highlighting and readability.
  - **Links to Documentation**: For advanced or company-specific rules, link to relevant documentation (e.g., Salesforce documentation for Apex standards).

</details>

<details>
  <summary>3. Clarity and Simplicity</summary>
  
  - **Keep it Simple**: Write standards in simple, concise language that is easy to understand.
  - **Justification and Explanation**: Provide reasoning for each rule, explaining why itâ€™s necessary.
  - **Avoid Overwhelming Detail**: Focus on essential, impactful guidelines, avoiding overcomplication.
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary>4. Real-World Examples</summary>
  
  - **Good and Bad Examples**: Show both good and bad examples of code with explanations for each.
  - **Use Case Scenarios**: Provide practical examples of when to apply certain coding standards.
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary>5. Versioning and Updates</summary>
  
  - **Changelog**: Include a changelog that tracks updates to the coding standards.
  - **Use Git Version Control**: Use Git to track changes to standards, maintaining a version history.
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary>6. Enforcement Tools</summary>
  
  - **Static Code Analyzers**: Recommend or integrate tools like **ESLint** (for JavaScript) or **PMD** (for Apex) to enforce the standards.
  - **Pre-commit Hooks**: Suggest using Git pre-commit hooks to ensure standards are met before committing code.
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary>7. Collaboration and Contribution</summary>
  
  - **Collaborative Input**: Invite feedback from team members and include a process for contributing new standards.
  - **Peer Reviews**: Encourage peer code reviews to check for adherence to coding standards.
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary>8. Keep It Up to Date</summary>
  
  - **Ongoing Maintenance**: Review and update the document regularly to ensure it remains relevant.
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary>9. Customizable Template for Standards</summary>
  
  Create a template for adding new coding standards with the following sections:
  - Rule Name
  - Rule Description
  - Example Code (Good/Bad)
  - Why It Matters
  - Enforcement Mechanism (if any)
  - Related Links/Resources
  
</details>

# Best Practices for Adding Coding Standards to a Knowledge Base

Below are the best practices for documenting coding standards. Click on each section to expand the details.

<details>
  <summary>1. Structure and Organization</summary>
  
  - **Use Clear Categories**: Break down the coding standards into logical categories like "General Coding Standards," "Apex Coding Standards," and "LWC Coding Standards" to improve navigation.
  - **Subsections for Specific Topics**: Within each category, create subsections for topics like Naming Conventions, Commenting, Error Handling, etc.
  - **Table of Contents**: Include a table of contents at the top with links to sections for easier navigation.
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary>2. Consistent Formatting</summary>
  
  - **Markdown Usage**: Use consistent headers (`#`, `##`, `###`), lists, and code blocks to make the document visually appealing.
  - **Code Examples**: Provide code examples in fenced code blocks (```language) to ensure syntax highlighting and readability.
  - **Links to Documentation**: For advanced or company-specific rules, link to relevant documentation (e.g., Salesforce documentation for Apex standards).

</details>

<details>
  <summary>3. Clarity and Simplicity</summary>
  
  - **Keep it Simple**: Write standards in simple, concise language that is easy to understand.
  - **Justification and Explanation**: Provide reasoning for each rule, explaining why itâ€™s necessary.
  - **Avoid Overwhelming Detail**: Focus on essential, impactful guidelines, avoiding overcomplication.
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary>4. Real-World Examples</summary>
  
  - **Good and Bad Examples**: Show both good and bad examples of code with explanations for each.
  - **Use Case Scenarios**: Provide practical examples of when to apply certain coding standards.
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary>5. Versioning and Updates</summary>
  
  - **Changelog**: Include a changelog that tracks updates to the coding standards.
  - **Use Git Version Control**: Use Git to track changes to standards, maintaining a version history.
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary>6. Enforcement Tools</summary>
  
  - **Static Code Analyzers**: Recommend or integrate tools like **ESLint** (for JavaScript) or **PMD** (for Apex) to enforce the standards.
  - **Pre-commit Hooks**: Suggest using Git pre-commit hooks to ensure standards are met before committing code.
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary>7. Collaboration and Contribution</summary>
  
  - **Collaborative Input**: Invite feedback from team members and include a process for contributing new standards.
  - **Peer Reviews**: Encourage peer code reviews to check for adherence to coding standards.
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary>8. Keep It Up to Date</summary>
  
  - **Ongoing Maintenance**: Review and update the document regularly to ensure it remains relevant.
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary>9. Customizable Template for Standards</summary>
  
  Create a template for adding new coding standards with the following sections:
  - Rule Name
  - Rule Description
  - Example Code (Good/Bad)
  - Why It Matters
  - Enforcement Mechanism (if any)
  - Related Links/Resources
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary>10. Examples of Popular Coding Standards</summary>
  
  - Include references to well-known coding standards, such as:
    - **[Google JavaScript Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html)**
    - **[Salesforce Apex Best Practices](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_best_practices.htm)**
    - **[Airbnb React/JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)**

## Getting Started

To start contributing, follow these steps:
1. **Fork the repository**: Click the "Fork" button at the top-right corner.
2. **Clone the repository**: Clone your fork to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git

## How to Contribute

1. **Add New Content**:
   - All new additions must be well-documented and provide relevant examples when possible.
   - Ensure your content is clear and concise.

2. **Write in Markdown**:
   - Use appropriate headers (`#`, `##`, `###`) for clarity.
   - Keep bullet points or lists short and to the point.
   - Include code blocks where relevant:
     ```markdown
     ```bash
     # Sample code block
     echo "Hello, world!"
     ```
   - Ensure consistency across the document (spacing, indentation).

3. **Submit a Pull Request**:
   - Once you've made your changes, commit with a meaningful message:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Add new LWC coding standard"
     ```
   - Push to your fork:
     ```bash
     git push origin feature/your-feature-name
     ```
   - Open a pull request (PR) and provide a detailed description of the changes.
   - Link any relevant issues or discussions in the PR description.

## Review Process

Once you submit a pull request, a reviewer from our team will check for:
- Adherence to our coding standards
- Proper documentation and clarity
- Functional accuracy and completeness

We aim to review pull requests within 3-5 business days. You may be asked to make changes based on feedback. Once approved, your contribution will be merged into the main branch.


## Best Practices

- Follow our [Coding Standards](link-to-coding-standards).
- Include tests for any new feature (if applicable).
- Document your code thoroughly to make it easier for others to understand.

## Using ChatGPT for Assistance

If you're unsure about the structure of your documentation or need help generating markdown files, you can use ChatGPT as follows:

1. **Generate Markdown Files**: Ask ChatGPT to create a basic structure for your markdown file.
   - Example prompt: "Create a markdown template for a new coding standard in JavaScript."

2. **Edit Markdown Content**: Provide ChatGPT with raw content, and it can help structure, format, or proofread your markdown file.
   - Example prompt: "Help me improve the wording in this section of a markdown file."

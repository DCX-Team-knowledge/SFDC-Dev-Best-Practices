## How to Contribute

1. **Add New Content**:
   - If you're adding a new coding standard or best practice, please ensure it adheres to our [Coding Standards](link-to-coding-standards-page).
   - All new additions must be well-documented and provide relevant examples when possible.
   - Ensure your content is clear and concise.

2. **Write in Markdown**:
   - Use appropriate headers (`#`, `##`, `###`) for clarity.

3. **Submit a Pull Request**:
   - Once you've made your changes, commit with a meaningful message:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Add new LWC coding standard"
     ```
   - Push to your fork:
     ```bash
     git push origin feature/your-feature-name
     ```
   - Open a pull request (PR) and provide a detailed description of the changes.
   - Link any relevant issues or discussions in the PR description.

## Review Process

Once you submit a pull request, a reviewer from our team will check for:
- Adherence to our coding standards
- Proper documentation and clarity
- Functional accuracy and completeness

We aim to review pull requests within 3-5 business days. You may be asked to make changes based on feedback. Once approved, your contribution will be merged into the main branch.


## Best Practices

- Follow our [Coding Standards](link-to-coding-standards).
- Include tests for any new feature (if applicable).
- Document your code thoroughly to make it easier for others to understand.

## Using ChatGPT for Assistance

If you're unsure about the structure of your documentation or need help generating markdown files, you can use ChatGPT as follows:

1. **Generate Markdown Files**: Ask ChatGPT to create a basic structure for your markdown file.
   - Example prompt: "Create a markdown template for a new coding standard in JavaScript."

2. **Edit Markdown Content**: Provide ChatGPT with raw content, and it can help structure, format, or proofread your markdown file.
   - Example prompt: "Help me improve the wording in this section of a markdown file."

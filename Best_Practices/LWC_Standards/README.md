# Error Handling in Lightning Web Components (LWC)

Error handling is a crucial part of any application and should be incorporated from the design phase. In Lightning Web Components, error handling involves both server-side and client-side strategies to manage expected and unexpected errors gracefully. [Check the full example](../Exsamples.js).

### Server-Side Error Handling: 
- Use Apex methods with `try-catch` blocks to handle server-side exceptions and send user-friendly error messages to the client.
- Implement custom exception classes to provide meaningful error responses.

### Client-Side Error Handling:
- Use the `@wire` decorator to handle data fetching from Apex or Lightning Data Service (LDS).
- Capture errors during data provisioning and handling, ensuring any issues are managed and reported correctly.

### Displaying Errors:
- Implement a reusable component to consistently display error messages across various parts of the application.
- Ensure errors are shown in a user-friendly way that provides clear feedback to the user.
